# Dotfiles

My dotfiles. Finally, I got my computer to symlink all my custom dotfiles into a directory in my computer where I can create a git repo and push and share. Very nice. I did it using this fabulous tool called [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm). It took me embarrassingly long to get it, but I got it. If you need help getting it, open an issue and I'll help. Consider that my good charity so that no one ever loses their dotfiles.

Also important to note: I use Thoughtbot's
[dotfiles](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles) as my starting point, so as
you can see al my dotfiles end with .local for reasons. They are good reasons,
it just takes a while getting used to them.

Alright cheers, bye.
